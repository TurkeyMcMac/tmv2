This is an improved version of my other program 'termovie'. The input format is
almost compatible, but there can be no final frame separator after the final
frame. Unlike 'termovie', 'tmv2' uses the terminfo database rather than printing
hardcoded control sequences. It's also a bit simpler since it doesn't try to do
as much. If you want more information, you can run 'make', then run './tmv2 -h'
for an overview or 'man ./tmv2.6' for more in-depth information. It is also
possible to just view the file 'tmv2.6.in' to read the same information without
needing to run 'make' beforehand.

Several files are provided in the 'examples' directory with which you can try
out the command.

If you have Homebrew, you may be able to install this program as follows:

   brew install turkeymcmac/tap/tmv2

Otherwise, you could run something like this:

   make OPTIMIZATION=-O3
   sudo cp tmv2 <directory-in-path>
   sudo cp tmv2.6.gz <man-directory>

<man-directory> might be '/usr/share/man/man6/', for example.
